Task Filtering & Search
Users can filter tasks based on:

Status: All, Pending, Completed.

Priority: Low, Medium, High.

Responsive Design

Authentication
The app uses Laravel Sanctum for authentication. The frontend implements login and logout functionality and stores the authentication state in Pinia. After logging in, users will have access to task management features, and admin users will have additional permissions, such as task deletion.

Login Flow:
On successful login, a session token is stored and used for authenticated requests.

Admin users can delete and manage tasks.
